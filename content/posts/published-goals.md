## 1. Replace the light tubes in my office closet
My wife uses this light every single day to look in the closet when she's
getting dressed for work.

It's truly __infuriating__ to me that it flickers and barely puts off any
light. What the hell's the point of even having it?

## 2. Clear the floor of my office
There's a ton of clutter on my office floor right now that's keeping me
from effectively vacuuming in here.
