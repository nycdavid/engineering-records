## 1. Replace the light tubes in my office closet
My wife uses this light every single day to look in the closet when she's
getting dressed for work.

It's truly __infuriating__ to me that it flickers and barely puts off any
light. What the hell's the point of even having it?

### Update: 11/18/2019
This might be harder than we thought because _they don't make T12 bulbs anymore_.
We can mess around and twist the bulb and it will start to work again so we've
lowered the priority on this.

### Resolution:
_TBD_

## 2. Clear the floor of my office
There's a ton of clutter on my office floor right now that's keeping me
from effectively vacuuming in here.

## 3. Losing Weight/Physical Fitness
My weight has been extremely volatile over the last several years: I've gotten
as low as 175 pounds shortly before my wedding and have gone as high as 220
recently.

Emotional stress seems to affect my eating habits. Also, having too much free
time seems to get to me as well. For instance, I'll be doing well on a diet
and then will take a week off from work and my routine will get all thrown
into disarray. I've never been able to take a vacation while sticking to a diet.

My goal is to reduce my weight to 150 pounds. This is 25 pounds lower than my
record lowest weight (in recent times) of 175 pounds.
