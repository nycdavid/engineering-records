Having too many goals at one time is the easiest way to make sure that none
of them are completed. This isn't a particularly novel concept. Much of the
self-help literature that I've read over the ideas stresses the concept of
working on one thing and one thing only.

But what happens when you want to achieve __unrelated things__ but equally as
much?

For instance, my goals are as follows:

1. Becoming an expert programmer.
2. Becoming an expert computer scientist (many people conflate programming
  and computer science but, in reality, they're very different disciplines)
3. Becoming physically fit
4. Writing music
5. Starting a business

## Trying to find a common thread
Attempting to connect these 5 goals via some commonality and then finding an
activity that embodied that commonality was something that I spent some time
thinking about but nothing really came out of it.

Becoming an expert programmer and computer scientist are pretty related but
how do I tie that to becoming physically fit or writing music? Or, for that
matter, how are writing music and fitness related?

Trying to find a single activity that I could pour all of my time into and that
touched on all of these goals didn't seem viable.

## Different goals for different fulfillment
The thing that I realized about my goals is that they all fulfill different
values that I hold:

- __Writing music__ is related to how much I value being creative. I not only
  enjoy being creative but I love the thought of people enjoying the products
  of my creativity.
- __Physical fitness__ speaks to how much I value health. I want to enjoy life,
  the things in it and the things that I've achieved as much for as long as
  possible.
- __Starting a business__. This goal is a difficult one to assign a single
  value. Maybe because it's more of an anxiety rather than a core value.
    - I'm genuinely afraid of running out of money (or losing my job). This
      could possibly be due to the bout of unemployment that I struggled with
      in 2011-2012.
    - My fear about this seems even more augmented by the fact that I'm married
      and plan to have children soon.
- __Becoming an expert programmer/computer scientist__: I believe that I have
  a core value of wanting recognition for my abilities. This goal sounds
  shallow but I don't think I'm doing myself any favors by attempting to ignore
  this.

I think that there __is__ a common thread among all of these goals which is
this: they all relate to somehow receiving some sort of recognition.

## Taking stock of where I am right now
I wonder if my desire to receive recognition is getting in the way of being
able to enjoy the activities that I regularly engage in.

I often feel dissatisfied, even after a full day, that I'm not at the "end" of
something or that it hasn't been completed. I wonder now, if that's because I'm
not yet able to show someone the fruits of my labor because it isn't yet
finished.

If that's the case, I'm effectively deferring any satisfaction that I can get
out of a project until the very end, which, for very large projects, can mean
that I'll be dissatisfied for a __long__ time. Not to mention, staying
dissatisfied throughout a project almost guarantees that I'll burn out right
away and not be able to finish it.

This might explain why I have so many unfinished projects.

## Internal validation and satisfaction with incremental progress
As trite as this may sound, it seems like the antidote to this is somehow
finding validation with small bits of progress (i.e. "learning to love
the process")

I've heard that above phrase __A LOT__. But how do I actually implement this
in my life in an effective way?

I've experimented with incentivization in the past: I would set a goal and
then associate it with some item that I wanted to buy. Then I would work
on the goal and once I completed it, I would allow myself to buy that item.

This was okay. It would often work once or twice but it was difficult for me to
continue because of shifting priorities. I also wonder if my goals were too
superficial and not fundamental enough to keep going. For instance, a common
goal of mine is to my weight under a specific number, but sometimes I wonder
if this was something that's truly under my control?

Perhaps a goal that'd be more fundamental to me and my choices would have been
something like "stay under daily calorie goal".
