## Being on Autopilot
I've been happily married to my wife since 2019, so a little over 2 years now.

When we first moved in together, we learned a lot about each other and learning
to cohabitate was THE topic at the forefront of our minds in those early months.
It was really engaging because we were, in effect, learning a new skill set.

As we learned what to do and what not to do in order to live harmoniously
together, the thing that always happens when you practice a skill over and
over happened: we got __really good__ at living together.

What does it mean to be really good at living with my wife? I didn't have to
think about putting things away after using them (an action that I was
__notoriously__ bad at when I lived alone) or doing the dishes immediately.

All of these actions that I needed to make a conscious effort to do in the
beginning became habits of our household and took much less effort than before
to do. They became more automatic.

I'd argue that this is what you want when trying to develop a positive routine
in your day-to-day. The more automatic a behavior is, the less taxing it is on
your willpower (a definitively finite resource).

## Something feels weird
This was all great, but then I started to feel like something was kind of off.

Days or maybe even a week would pass, and, in a moment of self-awareness, I
would have an acute feeling that I had barely spent any time with my wife.

To be clear: we had spent nearly every moment together, save for our time at
our respective jobs. But in that moment, I had an unpleasant feeling that I
we had barely seen each other at all.

In fact, the cognitive dissonance owing to the fact that we had been physically
right next to each other, but mentally on autopilot made the feeling worse
somehow.
