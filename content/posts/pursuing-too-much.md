## Being on Autopilot
I've been happily married to my wife since 2019, so a little over 2 years now.

When we first moved in together, we learned a lot about each other and learning
to cohabitate was THE topic at the forefront of our minds in those early months.
It was really engaging because we were, in effect, learning a new skill set.

As we learned what to do and what not to do in order to live harmoniously
together, the thing that always happens when you practice a skill over and
over happened: we got __really good__ at living together.

What does it mean to be really good at living with my wife? I didn't have to
think about putting things away after using them (an action that I was
__notoriously__ bad at when I lived alone) or doing the dishes immediately.

All of these actions that I needed to make a conscious effort to do in the
beginning became habits of our household and took much less effort than before
to do. They became more automatic.

I'd argue that this is what you want when trying to develop a positive routine
in your day-to-day. The more automatic a behavior is, the less taxing it is on
your willpower (a definitively finite resource).

## Something feels weird
This was all great, but then I started to feel like something was kind of off.

Days or maybe even a week would pass, and, in a moment of self-awareness, I
would have an acute feeling that I had barely spent any time with my wife.

To be clear: we had spent nearly every moment together, save for our time at
our respective jobs. But in that moment, I had an unpleasant feeling that we
had barely seen each other at all.

In fact, the cognitive dissonance owing to the fact that we had been physically
right next to each other, but mentally on autopilot made the feeling worse
somehow.

## Cruise Control
I realized that our behaviors had become so automatic that we were
sometimes "auto-piloting" through the time we spent together (at least on
the weekdays).

It's natural for the brain to do this when faced with behavior repetition, and
it's this mechanism that allows humans to function and improve their skills.

What if every time you had to drive, you had to consciously think about every
single movement you were making? Driving, especially if you're behind the
wheel of a vehicle with a manual transmission, involves quite a few
semi-complex motor skills that must all work in tandem together.

If you had to consciously keep all of this in your head, how could you even
pay attention to the road?

Thus, the brain "caches" the actions that are repetitive like how to accelerate,
how to break, changing gears, activating your turn signals, etc. so that you
can focus on what's truly important: the road ahead and ensuring there's a
clear and safe path to proceed.

## How we're combatting this
I suggested to my wife that we have a "family meeting" once a week (on Sundays)
where we talk about the week that has just passed and goals for the week ahead.

We cast to our Chromecast from my laptop and keep Todoist (our preferred task
manager) open while we talk through any tasks that we want to accomplish during
the week ahead.

The above is acting as a pilot program where we experiment with different ways
in which we can be more present and involved with each other. I'd like to
introduce similar ways in which we can be more present while we're with each
other during the weekdays when we have much less time.

The bottom line, though, is that I don't want to lose even one more day to
automaticity. We only have one life, and time is an inherently non-renewable
resource. There's no reason that we can't spend each day where we're 100%
present and with each other, at least for a little bit.

I don't believe this is too much to ask of ourselves. But in this modern day
and age of the persistent connection and ever-present distraction that we call
the internet, it is definitely becoming more difficult. I caution all not to
fall into this trap.
