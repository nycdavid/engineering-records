Starting a business has been something that I've wanted to do for a very long
time. The reasons are varied but they mostly seem to revolve around the
following:

- I grew up somewhat poor. Financial security is therefore important to me.
- Both my wife and I have aging parents to care for that immigrated to the
  United States and have no retirement savings.
- I want to provide luxuries for both my wife and future children.
- One of the feelings that I enjoy most in life is taking pride in something
  that I've directly created.

## The Goal
I've experimented with different kinds of goal setting in the past: writing
things down, mind mapping, visualizing, etc. and all have had some benefits
but this time I'm going to try using the __SMART__ technique of goal setting:

- S: Specific
- M: Measurable
- A: Attainable
- R: Relevant
- T: Time-constrained

## S: Specific
I want to earn $5,000 of passive pre-tax income per month. Let's break that
down:

- __Passive__: I don't want to freelance. That's just trading my hours for
  money and ignores the leverage that I'm trying to obtain.
- __Pre-tax income__: It's okay for this to be untaxed revenue that I later
  have to pay taxes on when I report it to the IRS. $5,000 of _after-tax revenue_
  seems a little ambitious right now.

## M: Measurable
This can be easily measured by amounts deposited into our shared checking
account.  I can get totals by doing a simple search in either Chase or Personal
Capital.

## A: Attainable
This goal is a hefty one, but I believe it's 100% attainable.

[Mike Perham](https://www.mikeperham.com) (the creator of the Ruby library
[Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)) generates $60,000 in revenue
per month and he's a solo founder.  Granted it took him __years__ and lots of
hardwork to get there but I'm only aiming for a fraction of that (at first).

## R: Relevant
Does this goal align with my broader goals?

My ultimate goal is:
- Financial independence for both my wife, myself and our immediate family.
- The above includes our parents and my wife's brother and sister-in-law.

This smaller goal is so relevant, in fact, that I can't possibly imagine
achieving my ultimate goal without attempting to start a business, short of
winning the lottery.

## T: Time-constrained
The time constraint is in the title: I'm giving myself 18 months, which places
us at about May, 2021.

Is 18 months enough time to build a business that earns $5,000 in MRR? I really
don't know. I've never attempted to build a business and have no idea how long
it takes.

The best thing that can happen from this exercise is simply honing in on what
starting a business actually requires. I should know in 18 months whether or
not this experiment was a success or a complete bust (in all likelihood, I'll
know much sooner than that...)
