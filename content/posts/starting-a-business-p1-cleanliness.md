## Why cleanliness?
For better or for worse, the mental model that I've used throughout my life is
that all things are connected.

For me, that means that how clean my home is, how fit I am, how much alcohol I
drink on a weekly basis, how much exercise I get, etc. all affect my ability
to start a business to varying degrees.

Whether this is, in fact, true, I have no idea but one thing I do know is that
all of the above do end up being distractions to me and __distractions__
definitely affect my ability to start a business.

To address that, I've attempted to formulate and codify some guiding principles for my
life. Here's what I've got so far:

## Prefer less to more
This will typically apply in all situations except for net worth or other
things that are drains on resources like material goods, cars, unwanted
obligations, etc.

I think I'm doing fairly well in this category. I have a lot less obligations
than most. I think I can do a better job on eliminating physical goods though
(or at least start putting more stuff into storage).

## Remove distractions
This can be both mental and physical. Right now, my desk has a lot of one-off
things on it:

- can of compressed air
- stack of papers
- ear plugs
- random receipt
- coffee mug
- bluetooth speaker
- external battery

All of this stuff really catches my eye whenever I sit at my desk, and I can't
imagine it's doing my productivity any favors.

A mental example of this would be something like eliminating smartphone
notifications and the like from my field of vision while I'm working, at least
for lengthy blocks of time so I can get into a flow state.

## Keep things clean
The mental analogy that I often use for my house is that of an engine or piece
of machinery.

In order to keep that engine operating efficiently and without incident, I need
to do the chores that keep it clean: doing the laundry, vacuuming, doing the
dishes, cleaning the bathroom, etc.

I've found that a somewhat large impediment to cleaning the floor is just the
sheer amount of stuff that we keep on the floor. Things that should be in
storage or items we don't use everyday but that were used recently and just
left there.

Moving these things when it comes time to clean becomes such a lift that we
just often __don't__ vacuum or just do it partially. This is particularly an
issue in my home office where there is just so much stuff that I haven't
vacuumed in months.

The ideal I'm shooting for here is completely clear floor that allows me
to run a Swiffer dry from end to end.

## How are these things related to entrepreneurship?
For most folks, __they aren't__. A lot of people are much better than I am at
ignoring external factors like this.

I've found, however, that I'm deeply affected by the environment that I'm in
and that tidiness and a general feeling that things are taken care of are
things that are required for me to work effectively.

Additionally, the habit of cleaning is one that has to be developed, just like
the habit of developing a business day-after-day is one that needs to be
developed.

In keeping with this, I'm going to be keeping a
[living document](/posts/published-goals) on this blog that keeps track of the
different goals that I want to achieve for both the house and myself.

I'll edit this post with [the link](/posts/published-goals) once it's ready.
